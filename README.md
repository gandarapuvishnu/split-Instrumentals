# Split-instrumentals

Using an open source package called [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter), we can split the instrumentals involved in a audio file into seperate sources.

Simple steps to proceed:
1. Clone repo
2. Install python 3.7 (only)
3. Open command prompt in this environment
4. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
5. Cache the 'Dependencies' directory at environment variable 'Path'.
6. Run 'python main.py'

Note: Make sure the path has no empty spaces in between.!
